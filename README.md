# dna-visualisation
The aim of this project was to creat a basic data visualisation that depicts bar graphs in the form of DNA strands. It was
originally used to display internal company quarterly goals progress as part of a larger reporting dashboard. Specific company
data has been replaced with generic terms and names for the purpose of this publication.

To view the visualisation in full, with animation etc, please go to: https://javabster.github.io/dna-visualisation/

The visualisation is made up of 2 parts: 
- A large DNA strand depicting 4 high level categories (a different helix colour is used for each category)
- A series of smaller DNA strands that represent the items that make up each of the larger categories (helix colour matches the
higher level category that those items belong to)

The green colour of the inner bars of the DNA helixes represent the percentage completion of the task for the small DNA strand,
or the percentage completion of the category as a whole for the large DNA strand.

The smaller DNA strand also contains animation which loops through the helix, highlighting certain sections by enlarging
the helix and displaying relevant captions.
